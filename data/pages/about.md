headline_title: MRC-ET Advanced Laboratory
headline_detail: MRC-ET is an affiliate of MRC Holland; a Netherlands based
  Biotechnology Company, which is specialized in production and supply of a
  proprietary product, MLPA® kits and an assortment of materials needed in a
  molecular biology facility. The kits, produced by MRC-Holland, are primarily
  used as diagnostic tools and/or for research purposes, for genetic screening
  of diverse hereditary disorders and syndromes as well as diseases/conditions
  that may result as a consequence of various changes in the human genome.
aims_and_objectives:
  - Introduce a simple and cost efficient genetic screening technique
  - Promote and introduce MLPA® kits as diagnostic and research tools
  - Explore, through research and development, prevalent hereditary diseases in
    the population
  - Provide graduate and post graduate level advanced training in molecular
    diagnostics and recent advances in molecular biological techniques
  - Prepare annual publication to disseminate the technology and the findings in
    collaboration with stakeholders
  - Develop detection methods of prevalent hereditary diseases in the population

# Who are we?

MRC-ET is headed by **Dr. Zewdu Terefework**. Dr. Zewdu received his M.Sc. and PhD from the department of **Applied Chemistry** and **Microbiology** at the **University of Helsinki**. He also holds a number of certificates on genomic medicine, genomic technologies in clinical diagnostics and clinical bioinformatics. He has worked at the same university for several years as an instructor and a senior researcher in EU and Academy of Finland funded projects. For three and a half years he has worked as a post-doctoral researcher in a molecular biology and cell physiology lab at the **Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam**, **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**, and **MRC-Holland**, the Netherlands, where he developed MLPA diagnostic kit for identification and relative quantification of oral bacteria. Prior to his return to Ethiopia he has been working as a senior scientist at MRC-Holland where he developed an in-house protocol for STR analysis for forensic purposes, and worked on development of MLPA kits for tropical diseases and human genetic diseases. He has published several research articles in peer reviewed international scientific journals and contributed chapters in books. He has presented his findings in several international conferences.
