title: Genetic Defects
description: A genetic disorder is a disease caused in whole or in part by a
  change in the DNA sequence away from the normal sequence. Genetic disorders
  can be caused by a mutation in one gene (monogenic disorder), by mutations in
  multiple genes (multifactorial inheritance disorder), by a combination of gene
  mutations and environmental factors, or by damage to chromosomes (changes in
  the number or structure of entire chromosomes, the structures that carry
  genes).
