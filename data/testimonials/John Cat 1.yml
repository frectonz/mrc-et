  This letter comes From the desk of Mr. Trevor John Toews as a testimonial in
  regards to our experience with the MRC-ET Advanced Laboratory in Addis Ababa.
  I am currently living and working in Ethiopia as the Country Representative
  for the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite. The organization is involved in
  humanitarian projects, printing literature, evangelism, church planting, etc.
  My wife and five children are also living here with me. Due to the demanding
  nature of the assignment given to me, it is very costly and difficult for us
  to leave the country for any reason during our committed term here. Recently,
  our fifth child was born in the Kadisco Hospital in Addis Ababa. 

  In the months leading up to the birth of this child, we were highly concerned about several things. One of our other children was born with a rare metabolic genetically transmitted disease called MCADD (Medium-Chain Acyl-coa Dehydrogenase Disorder) Since my wife and I are carriers of this disease, our children all have a substantial risk of contracting the disease. We were concerned that there was not sufficient technology in Addis Ababa to screen for this disease and other diseases. We wanted full DNA scanning of our new child and considered leaving the country to give birth to the child for this reason. However, leaving the country would have required many costly arrangements and would have been very inconvenient and disruptive to our family and our work. Our decision whether or not to remain in the country to give birth to the baby was largely based on this concern. After a brief research, we learned about Dr. Zewdu Terefework and his highly sophisticated laboratory called MRC-ET Advanced Laboratory. Going there, we were told that the screening and DNA testing needed in our

  case was all very possible, and could be done in the country of Ethiopia. It was our understanding that the MRCET Advanced Laboratory was the only establishment with the technology and ability to perform these tests. We immediately made plans to use these services.

  Dr. Zewdu very professionally did some DNA testing on our other child who was affected by the disease and prepared to test our new child as soon as he was born.

  Our child was born on January 25th and we received excellent care from the health professionals at Kadisco

  Hospital. Immediately, blood samples were given to the MRC-ET Laboratory. We received a full report of our

  childâ€™s DNA makeup and the results of all the screening that was done. We were very pleased with the

  professional service and amazing capabilities of Dr. Zewdu Terefework and his laboratory. 

  Our testimony is that Ethiopia is a better country because of what Dr. Zewdu is doing. To have these capabilities

  inside this country was a huge advantage for us and will continue to help many families with their most difficult

  health challenges. We are forever thankful for the help we received from MRC-ET Advanced Laboratory.
